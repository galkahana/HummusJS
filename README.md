**Update 9/11/2019 Ending Support:**  
Hi All, after 6 years I decided to finish supporting HummusJS. You may still use the code as is, with the provided license, however I will not be providing answers, solutions, responses etc.  

If you want to continue using HummusJS and are looking for a maintained version you can move to [MuhammaraJS](https://github.com/julianhille/MuhammaraJS) which is a drop in replacement for HummusJS. Thanks [Julianhille](https://github.com/julianhille) for maintaining it.

I'd like to thank everyone who used HummusJS and wish you all the best going forward with your projects.   
Gal.
